<h1>sanctom test</h1>
<p>in this repo I have created a project that has the auth we want in any project using tokens and the default sanctom auth middleware</p>
<h2>How to use</h2>
<h3>1:create a Project</h3>
<p>when createing a new project the project already has a user tabeel and user migration and I have created a posts tabel but you can use any kind of models you want and it wont be any diffirent at all </p>
<h3>2:add HasAPIToken</h3>
<p>in any model you create just make sure you have the HasAPIToken added in the code "if you are using the auth for an api"</p>
<h3>3:create the AuthController </h3>
<p>if you have this project you dont need to create the controller , but in a new project you do need to create it and add the functions for [login , register , logout]</p>
<h1>Enjoy!</h1>
